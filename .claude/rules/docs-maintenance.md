When modifying code in a directory that contains a `CLAUDE.md` file, check whether your changes affect the documented
architecture, key decisions, or gotchas. If they do, update the `CLAUDE.md` to stay in sync. If you notice a `CLAUDE.md`
missing in a directory where there should be one, add it. Skip this for trivial changes like bug fixes, formatting,
small refactors that don't change the architecture).
